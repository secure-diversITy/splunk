#   Have you ever started splunk> as the wrong user? Oh well if you HAVE you know what I
#   mean. This helper here exists to avoid those forever!
#     - Never worry about doing splunk> related commands with the correct user!
#     - No need to switch from user <root> to your splunk> user
#   just configure this helper with the installation path and splunk> username and after
#   doing the symlinks you are done.

    * USAGE INFO *
    **************

    -h | --help         This help/usage info
    --update            Easy self-update the shelper. Needs root permission.
                        You CAN specify an URL to the update ZIP - if you like. Otherwise the default update
                        URL is used (stable releases by default).
                        It will download the new version and install it automatically afterwards.

                        Defining a custom update URL enables you to deploy a new version of shelper for your
                        internal network when not every server has access to the internet or if you want to
                        download an unstable/developer version of shelper.
                        You can combine "shelperexchange" with "shelper --update <URL>". Nice isnt it? ;)
                        
                        Example:
                        splunk> server named "A" downloads a new shelper version from git
                        and you want to deploy it on splunk> server B:
                        1) (A) --> $> cd /tmp
                        2) download the latest stable release:
                           (A) --> $> wget https://github.com/secure-diversITy/splunk/archive/master.zip
                            or if you like it bleeding edge:
                           (A) --> $> wget https://github.com/secure-diversITy/splunk/archive/dev_splunkhelper.zip
                        3) (A) --> $> shelperexchange 5555
                        4) start the update on server B as user "root" (otherwise you cannot install):
                           (B) --> #> shelper --update http://serverA:5555/master.zip (or "dev_splunkhelper.zip")

    --batch                     Will not ask for any user input. If something goes wrong (e.g. authentication credentials are
                                missing) shelper will abort.

    -auth user:password         Every(!) command which require authentication against the splunk> API (e.g. shelperreload)
     (SINGLE dash!)             accepts this parameter to set user and password.

                                        which will reload both in 1 single run

    General commands (not directly shelper> related):
    ****************************************************************************************************************
    $> shelperexchange              Requires python (provides the server module) and perl (for the timeout).
                                    Starts a simple python http server in the CURRENT directory. You can specify
                                    a tcp port - if not: default is 8888.
                                    **DUE TO SECURITY REASONS IT WILL STOP AFTER '$HTTPTIMER' SECONDS AUTOMATICALLY!**
                                    Really helpful when deploying things..
                                    (real exec: "python -m SimpleHTTPServer <PORT>")
                                    Really helpful for updating shelper in large environments!
                                    Checkout --update to combine shelperexchange with updating.

                                    Example 1:
                                    "$> shelperexchange" --> will start a webserver in the current directory
                                    on port 8888. If your hostname is "foo" you can then download all files of
                                    that directory by pointing to http://foo:8888/

                                    Example 2:
                                    "$> shelperexchange 9999" --> will use port 9999 instead
